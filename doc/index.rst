Coverage
--------

The `coverage report <coverage>`_ generated by lcov gives insight in include,
source and test coverage.

Documentation building
----------------------

When creating a build including documentation using ``cmake
-DDOC=*somesphinxtarget*`` then a python script is created at
``buildir/doc/sphinx/sphinx_multibuild_runner.py``. This is a runner script 
that can build the documentation where all the necessary sphinx params are 
handled for you. There is also a handy mode where build on change is supported.

There are two optional arguments for the script:

- **-q**: Quiet sphinx build.
- **-m**: Monitor the doc directory and automatically rebuild on a change.
