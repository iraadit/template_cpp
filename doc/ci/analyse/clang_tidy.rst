clang_tidy
==========

When configuring with ``-DCLANG_TIDY:BOOL=ON`` all source files will be checked
by ``clang-tidy`` when compiling. This happens only when any source file itself
is being compiled, it does not waste time by always running on all sources.

Note that only sources files built will be checked, if you want to check the
tests you must also configure with ``-DTEST:BOOL=ON``.

When configuring with ``-DWERROR:BOOL=ON`` all warnings generated by
``clang-tidy`` will be turned into errors.
