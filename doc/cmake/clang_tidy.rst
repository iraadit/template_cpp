clang_tidy
==========

.. note::
	Checking happens during compilation of a source file. If you want to
	check tests you must also configure with ``-DTEST:BOOL=ON`` in addition
	to the below.

When configuring with ``-DCLANG_TIDY:BOOL=ON`` all source files will be checked
by ``clang-tidy`` when compiling. This happens only when any source file itself
is being compiled, it does not waste time by always running on all sources.

When also configuring with ``-DWERROR:BOOL=ON`` all warnings generated by
``clang-tidy`` will be turned into errors.
