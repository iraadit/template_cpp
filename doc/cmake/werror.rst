werror
======

When configuring with ``-DWERROR:BOOL=ON`` warnings are turned into errors.
This affects not only compiler warnings, but also many other checks, tools and
documentation generators.

If supported it will be explicitly listed on the page of an option. Details of
how the option is implemented for it will also be given.
