API documentation
=================

API documentation is automatically generated with two methods, each with two
different index types. Note that C functions are not part of a namespace or
class and therefore aren't listed in the element type indexes.

* `Source file: by filename <file/index.html>`_
* `Source file: by element name <file/genindex.html>`_
* `Element type: by type <type/index.html>`_
* `Element type: by name <type/genindex.html>`_
