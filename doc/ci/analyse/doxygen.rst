analyse/doxygen
===============

.. note::

	You may notice doxygen runs not only in this job, but also in the
	``doc/sphinx_html`` job. Due to a bug in Doxygen warnings will be
	emitted when XML output is enabled. This job builds only HTML so that
	valid warnings can be caught and reported on by CI.

When configuring with ``-DDOC:STRING=doxygen`` target ``doc`` will be added.
Running ``make doc`` will then run ``doxygen`` over all source code. This
generates HTML API documentation.

This will not run any sphinx-based jobs and therefore will not build any
documentation stored in ``/doc``.

When also configuring with ``-DWERROR:BOOL=ON`` all warnings generated by
``doxygen`` will be turned into errors.
