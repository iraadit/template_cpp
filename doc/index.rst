Coverage
--------

The `coverage report <coverage>`_ generated by lcov gives insight in include,
source and test coverage.

Documentation building
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCODE:BOOL=OFF -DDOC:STRING=html ..
	make doc

In order to build documentation you can need to set ``DOC`` to:

* ``doxygen`` to generate only Doxygen HTML API pages;
* any other string will be seen as a sphinx output type and handled as such.
	Refer to http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/builders.html for details.

Sanitization
------------

When the sanitization option is set in CMake various sanitizers will be used
to verify correctness. AddressSanitizer (ASan), LeakSanitizer (LSan), and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan) are used to catch memory errors and
undefined behaviour during run-time.

.. warning::

	LSan uses ptrace to attach a tracer thread to the program that is
	being tested. Docker containers run without the SYS_PTRACE capability
	by default. In order for the CI to work properly the docker container
	should be run with the SYS_PTRACE capability. See
	https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run on how to add specific
	capabilities.
