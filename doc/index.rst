Documentation for https://git.mel.vin/.

GitLab Pages
------------

Published pages end up at ``doc.mel.vin/user/project`` instead of the usual
``user.some.tld/project``. In other words, all pages are hosted on the same
subdomain which is a security problem for dynamic websites. **Do not use this
service for secure dynamic websites**, sync to your own host instead.
