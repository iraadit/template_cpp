Coverage
--------

The `coverage report <coverage>`_ generated by lcov gives insight in include,
source and test coverage.

Documentation building
----------------------

When creating a build including documentation using ``cmake
-DDOC=*somesphinxtarget*`` then a python script is created at
``buildir/doc/sphinx/sphinx_multibuild_runner.py``. This is a runner script
that can build the documentation where all the necessary sphinx params are
handled for you. There is also a handy mode where build on change is supported.

There are two optional arguments for the script:

- **-q**: Quiet sphinx build.
- **-m**: Monitor the doc directory and automatically rebuild on a change.

Sanitization
------------

AddressSanitizer (ASan), LeakSanitizer (LSan), and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
(UBSan) are used to catch memory errors and undefined behaviour during
run-time.

.. WARNING::

	LSan is enabled by default on Linux and uses ptrace to attach a tracer
	thread to the program that is being tested. Docker containers run
	without the SYS_PTRACE capability by default. In order for the CI to
	work properly the docker container should be run with the SYS_PTRACE
	capability. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run on how
	to add specific capabilities.
